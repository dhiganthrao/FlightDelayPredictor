# Flight Delay Prediction using a Two-Stage ML Model

This repository contains the code I used to create a two-stage model to classify and predict delay (in minutes) of flights based on historical flight data. The notebooks may be a ~bit messy~(really messy), so please pardon me.\
My report containing the results I obtained is also present. Feel free to go through it.
